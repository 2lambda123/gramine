The Make scripts in this directory (Makefile, Makefile.*, manifest.mk) are legacy code intended to
support the remaining parts of Gramine that aren't yet moved to Meson (regression tests, GCC build).

They should not be used for any new components, and once the Meson move is complete, they should be
deleted.
